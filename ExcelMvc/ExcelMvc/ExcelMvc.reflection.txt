# This file lists the file name patterns to be used by ExcelMvc for discovering
# assembly types at runtime. Each line specifies one pattern. Lines starting 
# with # or blank lines are discarded.
#
# All files in $(TargetDir) that end with .reflection.txt will be used. *.dll
# is used when no patterns are defined.
