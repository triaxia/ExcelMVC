ExcelMvc 
Writing Excel applications in C# using a MVC design

If you are a fan of building applications using a MVC design and you love Excel
as the user interface for your applications, then ExcelMvc is the right component for you.
It enables you to develop Excel applications with little or no VBA code. Everything you write
can be tested, making the Test-Driven-Development with Excel a possibility for the first time.

Simply download the ExcelMvc source code and follow the Sample solution to get your ExcelMvc
development started.

More documentation will be included in the Sample solution.
